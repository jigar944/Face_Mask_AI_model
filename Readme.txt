Submitted Files:

1) Source code: A jupyter notebook containing python code having complete CNN implemented using PyTorch.

2) Datasets: Zip file containing images for five different classes required for training and testing of CNN model.

3) Trained model: After trainning the CNN model using datasets, it is been saved using the service provided by google colab which will be used later on for testing.

4) README file: It contains information regarding files which have been uploaded during the submission of project and information regarding content of files and steps
to test the pre-trained model.

5) Project report (PDF): It describes the project's progress, milestones achieved, and roadblocks. Additionally, a high-level overview of why you're doing a project.

6) Originality form: An originality form signed by project group members stating that work done in project is completely original and done by group members.


How to run code in order to train and test model?
 - Set the path to load the dataset from the google drive or the local device.
 - Next step is to run the cells to start training and testing of the CNN model.
 - There is a separate cell representing evaluation report, i.e precision, recall, accuracy and F1-score and confusion matrix.

How to test the pre-trained CNN model?
 - Set the path to load the pre-trained CNN model in the last cell.
 - Set the path to load the images which will be passed to the model for classification.
 - After that result will be generated.

In the last part of the code we have already defined code for the different categories. So, you can directly load the trained model and evaluate the performance.
